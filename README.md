# ScriptWrapper

A module to improve the development of plugins for video games.

# Credits

This module was developed with many different tools and libraries, here is a list of things that I used in my source code and final binaries that weren't made by me (you can find the full list on [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

**[Plugin-SDK]** - I took major inspiration from this development kit to bring similar features to ScriptWrapper, in fact I used some of their source code due to it being superb (it's marked with comments)
*by __Dmitry K.__, __fastman92__, __LINK/2012__ and contributors.*

**[MinHook]** *fork by __Katayama Hirofumi MZ.__* - this is the main library I used to create detours from the game's functions
*original by __Tsuda Kageyu__, __Michael Maltsev__, __Andrey Unis__  and contributors.*
